<p>Apologies for the bland appearance! This website is still in construction.</p>

<h3>About me</h3>
<p>Hello! I'm Kyle, a third-year at the University of California, Berkeley. I've had a lifelong fascination with digital media such as games and animation, and I'd love opportunities to further explore my passion. I'm also interested in learning more about distributed and parallel computing as well as computer graphics.</p>
<p>Below you can find some of my personal projects and computer science coursework.</p>

<h3>Graphics</h3>
<p>The following are all projects I completed as part of CS 184, Berkeley's Computer Graphics and Imaging course. I took this class in the Spring 2017 semester with Professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren_Ng">Ren Ng</a>.</p>
<a href="cs184/proj1_rasterizer/index.html">Rasterizer</a>
 | <a href="cs184/proj2_meshedit/index.html">Mesh Edit</a>
 | <a href="cs184/proj3_1_pathtracer/index.html">Pathtracer (Part 1)</a>
 | <a href="cs184/proj3_2_pathtracer/index.html">Pathtracer (Part 2)</a>
 | <a href="cs184/proj4_clothsim/index.html">Clothsim</a>
 | <a href="https://kxqzhou.github.io/E-minor-engine/website/">Final Project</a>

<h3>Games</h3>
<p><a href="https://kxqzhou.github.io/Memo/">Memo</a>: A silly memory game I created to learn about Cocos2D-HTML5, the JavaScript branch of the Cocos2D game engine framework. It's very simple and unpolished, with no graphics whatsoever.</p>

<p><strong>Go-Tron</strong>: A small concurrent game server I implemented using Go (Golang) and WebSockets for real-time communication. The front-end is intended to resemble a Tron / Light-Cycles game, although at the moment the gameplay logic is not fully finished yet.</p>

<h3>Other</h3>
<p><strong>Image Compression with Apache Spark</strong>: This was done as part of Berkeley's CS 61C class (Computer Architecture / Machine Structures). By using the MapReduce paradigm, I parallelized a DCT image compression algorithm, allowing it to process multiple images at once.</p>

<p><strong>Frename</strong>: A small command-line tool written in Go that provides functions for renaming files grouped within a folder. Features are renaming into a sequence [name][1 ... 10 ], adding prefixes / suffixes, or replacing text.</p>

<h3>Film</h3>
<p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWNKypV_Vjg">Water Cycle</a>: The first 3D animated short I had the opportunity to be a part of, thanks to the <a href="http://ucbugg.com/">UCBUGG</a> decal (a student-run course) at Berkeley. I worked on various parts of the pipeline including animation and modeling. I also recently became a student facilitator for UCBUGG and am working to contribute code to the website.</p>

<p><strong>The Only Love a Man's Ever Known</strong>: This was a 30 second short created as part of a special year-long course at Berkeley called <a href="http://cnm190.com/">CNM 190</a>. I had the privelege of being on the Only Love team with 11 other peers far more talented and capable than me. My contributions to the short include modeling and rigging the  as well as first pass animation and lighting in the first scene.</p>
